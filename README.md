Musicociel orchestrator
===

This repository contains a server allowing multiple Musicociel clients to be orchestrated to display the same song at the same time, at the same position.

To install it globally, you can use yarn:

```
yarn global add @musicociel/orchestrator
```

Or if you prefer npm:

```
npm install -g @musicociel/orchestrator
```

This installs a global `musicociel-orchestrator` command.

This is a work in progress. More documentation will be added later.
